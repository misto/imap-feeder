Migrate to Feedzirra (http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/tree/master)!

Ideas for further development:
* Adding new feeds through rssimap, without manually editing the file.
* make the position of the link to the original configurable

* user-hooks that can interact with the feed processing:
 * to ignore items
 * custom body, e.g. fetch content with hpricot
 * code directly in the feedy.yml
  * or an external file, with an ID to identify the feed

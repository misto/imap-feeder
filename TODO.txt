Ideas for further development:
* Adding new feeds through rssimap, without manually editing the file.
* HTML-Mails (really?)
* make the position of the link to the original configurable
* embed images (e.g. for dilbert)

* user-hooks that can interact with the feed processing:
 * to ignore items
 * custom body, e.g. fetch content with hpricot
 * code directly in the feedy.yml
  * or an external file, with an ID to identify the feed
